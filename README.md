# The Division 2 Tips And Tricks

* When playing in a group don't always rush things. When you are about to begin an encounter there will sometimes be a lot of enemies clumped up. [They could all be CCed for easy take down or even killed instantly](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3p8op/the_division_2_tips_and_tricks/ej1w50r/).
* You can donate items towards projects right from the map screen without going back to base/settlement. You'll have to visit them to claim the rewards though.
* You can (re)activate bounties from the map screen, there is no need to visit NPC.
* Incinerator Turret can be toggled on and off. Turned off it has much longer lifetime. Consider turning it on only if necessary.
* Some of the [equipment caches are hanging in the air](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3ibvd/location_of_24no_air_drops_orange_crates/).
* [You can clear out Control Points at tier 1 before upgrading them](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3can1/psa_you_can_clear_out_control_points_at_tier_1/).
* Crafting table can be upgraded. Look at the bottom right of the screen after you unlock crafting table upgrading functionality.
* Wait for level 30 and specializations unlocked before doing side missions. They provide considerable experience boost for your field caches and spec points.
* You can disable other agents "Backup Requests". Go to the map, switch to the SHD tab and look at the bottom left of the screen for the respective action.
* You can explicitly queue for "Backup Requests" and automatically respond to them. Go to map, switch to the "Matchmake" tab and choose "Answer the Call". You will automatically accept next "Backup Request" and start loading into the session immediately after that. Make sure to not do anything important then as it won't place you back in the world when you return. You will be placed into the nearest safe zone to where you have been during the coop session instead.
* There is a "Progression Guide" in the game as well as tons and tons of different statistics, challenges and achievements. While in-game, go into the menu and select "Progression" item. Make srue to visit different tabs as well.There are also commendations rewards you can claim if you have completed any.
* It's much easier to navigate menus with keyboard then it is with mouse on PC. Try it out.
* You can [enable "Grid View" in the inventory](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b0p5ng/you_can_change_your_inventory_style_to_a_grid/). Check "Options" action at the bottom right of the screen with the inventory open.
* Completed missions, dark zone checkpoints, friendly control points, settlements, agents from your group and even [control point NPC attack group](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3y38t/a_helpful_feature_for_control_points/) can all be used as fast travel locations.
* It's enough to get all the Control Point resources to 50 to get the buff. If they are already above 50 - just talking to the officer is enough.
* Vaulting animation will be quicker if you leave the cover first.
* Most of the control points loot resets daily.
* Some SHD caches can be reached by [opening the door](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3l3iv/after_30_minutes_trying_to_find_a_way_into_the/).
* Complete all 3 strongholds to get access to specializations.
* Go from cover to cover with the special key. Agent seems to be much less likely to be shot that way.
* Press "back" (`esc` for PC) to [not turn away from the crafting table](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3pj9p/after_crafting_something_please_stop_my_character/) each time an item is crafted.
* While using the mini gun, [hold the left trigger](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3rop7/control_point_minigun_tip/ej1tfz8/) (`Right Mouse Button` for pc). This will keep the mechanism winding so when you use the right trigger you get instant firing, no delay.
* DZ level 10 allows for [free daily loot](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3vng4/get_your_dark_zone_level_to_at_least_level_10_as/).
* [Tag enemies](https://np.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3rtg2/tag_enemies_to_make_them_easier_for_your_squad_to/) by placing your crosshair directly over an an enemy for a brief period of time to make them easier to track in firefights.
