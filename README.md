# The Division 2 Tips And Tricks

* Incinerator Turret can be toggled on and off. Turned off it has much longer lifetime. Consider turning it on only if necessary.
* Some of the equipment caches are hanging on the trees.
* [You can clear out Control Points at tier 1 before upgrading them](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3can1/psa_you_can_clear_out_control_points_at_tier_1/).
* Crafting table can and should be upgraded. Look at the bottom right of the screen after you unlock crafting table upgrading functionality. Default button is `x` for PC.
* Wait for specializations to unlock before doing side missions. They provide considerable experience boost as well as specialization points (once you have those ulocked).
* You can disable other agents "Backup Requests". Go to the map, switch to the SHD tab and look at the bottom left of the screen for the button to use.
* You can explicitly queue for "Backup Requests" and automatically respond to them. Go to map, switch to the "Matchmake" tab and choose "Answer the Call". You will automatically accept next "Backup Request" and start loading into the session immediately after that. Make sure to not do anything important then as it won't place you back in the world when you return. You will be placed into the nearest safe zone to where you have been during the coop session instead.
* There is a "Progression Guide" in the game as well as tons and tons of different statistics, challenges and achievements. While in-game, go into the menu and select "Progression" item. Make srue to visit different tabs as well.There are also commendations rewards you can claim if you have completed any.
