* Crafting table can and should be upgraded. Look at the bottom right of the screen after you unlock crafting table upgrading functionality.
* Wait for specializations to unlock before doing side missions. They provide considerable experience boost as well as specialization points (once you have those ulocked).
* You can disable other agents "Backup Requests". Go to the map, switch to the SHD tab and look at the bottom left of the screen for the respective action.

You will automatically accept next "Backup Request" and start loading into the session immediately after that. Make sure to not do anything important then as it won't place you back in the world when you return. You will be placed into the nearest safe zone to where you have been during the coop session instead.

Make srue to visit different tabs as well.There are also commendations rewards you can claim if you have completed any.
